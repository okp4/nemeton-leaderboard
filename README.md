## Purpose & Philosophy

This repository holds the template for building Golang projects with a consistent set of standards accros all [OKP4](https://github.com/okp4) projects. We are convinced that the quality of the code depends on clear and consistent coding conventions, with an automated enforcement (CI).

This way, the template promotes:

- the use of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and [semantic releasing](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action) which automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the artifacts (project tarball, docker images, etc.)
- unit testing
- linting via [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
- a uniformed way of building the project for several platforms via a Makefile using a docker image

## How to use

> ðŸš¨ do not fork this repository as it is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

1. Click on [Use this template](https://github.com/okp4/template-go/generate)
2. Give a name to your project
3. Wait until the first run of CI finishes
4. Clone your new project and happy coding!

## Prerequisites

- Be sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) as well if you want to use the Makefile.

## Build

```sh
